Problem Statement

This dashboard provides a comprehensive financial analysis for businesses, helping stakeholders gain actionable insights into revenue trends, expense distributions, and profitability. It identifies critical financial metrics like net profit margin, cost-to-revenue ratios, and performance of key business units, enabling better decision-making.

Through visual representations of financial data, organizations can identify areas of improvement, monitor cash flow, and track KPIs efficiently. For instance, a sharp rise in operating expenses or a dip in net income is easily flagged for further investigation.

By addressing these areas, businesses can optimize their strategies and enhance their overall financial health.

Steps Followed

Data Preparation:

Imported the dataset (Excel file) into Power BI Desktop.

Reviewed data in the Power Query Editor and ensured cleanliness using the "Column Distribution," "Column Quality," and "Column Profile" options.

Enabled "Column Profiling Based on Entire Dataset" to evaluate all rows of data.

Data Cleaning:

Identified and removed null values from critical columns like "Revenue" and "Expenses," as they constituted less than 1% of the data.

Replaced any erroneous entries in the "Date" column to ensure consistency.

Data Transformation:

Created calculated columns to compute "Net Income" and "Profit Margin" using the following DAX expressions:

Net Income = Financial_Data[Revenue] - Financial_Data[Expenses]

Profit Margin = DIVIDE(Financial_Data[Net Income], Financial_Data[Revenue], 0)

Visual Design:

Added slicers for filtering by "Region," "Year," and "Business Unit" for dynamic analysis.

Created the following visuals:

Card Visuals: Displayed key metrics like Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Profit Margin.

Bar Charts: Showcased revenue and expenses across different business units.

Line Charts: Illustrated monthly trends in revenue and expenses.

Donut Chart: Represented expense breakdown by category.

Advanced Measures:

Created measures to calculate rolling averages for revenue and expenses:

Rolling Revenue = CALCULATE(SUM(Financial_Data[Revenue]), DATESINPERIOD(Date[Date], MAX(Date[Date]), -3, MONTH))

Rolling Expenses = CALCULATE(SUM(Financial_Data[Expenses]), DATESINPERIOD(Date[Date], MAX(Date[Date]), -3, MONTH))

Enhancing User Experience:

Added titles, tooltips, and labels to all visuals for clarity.

Customized the theme for a professional look using the "View" tab.

Included the company logo and a footer with additional context.

Insights Generation:

Published the dashboard to Power BI Service, enabling real-time collaboration.
